        <h1>Techsplore 2024</h1>
        <p>Thank you for attending Techsplore 2024! This is our second year executing Techsplore hybrid and we are so happy you were part of it. Techsplore is a three-day summer program we host yearly under a specific theme to encourage young girls to learn STEM and take the first step towards new fields.</p>
        <p>We had 60 girls attending in person at the American University of Beirut, and 200 attending online. We hope you benefitted from this journey and were able to make connections and learn new things!</p>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you are in the online audience, you might see new material. This is because you had access to different recordings and not all the material was the same between the online and the in-person audience!</p>
